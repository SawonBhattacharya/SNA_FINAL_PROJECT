 Data analyzing and network creation in Python using COVID-19 dataset. In this pandameic situation I have collected dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report for this project. After that I have trim a portion of data for my use. To run the python files you have import the following packeages and modules.

#import packages
